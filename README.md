#  Situation

A retail client operating multiple stores wanted to understand:
Which customer segments preferred specific products.
Which segments should be targeted to drive higher sales.
Whether changes in store layout or marketing strategy resulted in a measurable sales uplift.

# Task

Evaluate the impact of the trial by:

Performing exploratory customer and sales analysis.
Building a dashboard summarizing insights.
Identifying matched control stores.
Comparing trial vs control to quantify uplift statistically.

# Action

Conducted extensive EDA to understand customer behavior, segment preferences, and historical sales patterns.
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard providing Sales Overview, Customer Segmentation, and Store Performance insights.
Selected control stores based on similarity to the trial stores across multiple KPIs (correlation + distance metrics).
Applied normalization/scaling to align baseline performance for fair comparison.
Performed trial-period uplift analysis using confidence intervals and statistical validation.

# Result

Identified clear customer segments for targeted campaigns.
Measured the true uplift in trial stores beyond normal expected variation.
Demonstrated whether the new layout/strategy produced statistically significant sales improvement.
Delivered an executive-ready dashboard enabling business teams to monitor store performance and trial outcomes.

##  Overview

- Conducted a full sales uplift assessment using pre-trial baseline behaviour and matched control stores.  
- Normalized control-store performance using scaling to ensure fair comparison with trial stores.  
- Measured whether trial sales exceeded statistically expected ranges using confidence-based validation.  
- Designed a modern Power BI dashboard summarizing customer insights.

##  Key Outcomes

- One trial store showed a clear, statistically significant positive uplift during the marketing campaign.  
- Another trial store showed moderate uplift with mixed confidence.  
- Premium customers, specific brands, and young-family contributed meaningfully to uplift.  
- Power BI visualizations presenting sales Overview and Customer Analysis
