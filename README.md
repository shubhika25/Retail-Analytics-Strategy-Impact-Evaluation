# 🛒 Retail Marketing Trial – Sales Uplift Analysis  
### A Statistical Impact Evaluation Using Trial & Control Stores

This project evaluates the impact of a retail marketing trial by comparing trial-store performance against carefully matched control stores. The analysis identifies whether the trial produced a genuine, statistically reliable uplift in sales beyond expected behavior. Results are communicated through a clean, professional Power BI dashboard.

## 🔍 Overview

- Conducted a full sales uplift assessment using pre-trial baseline behaviour and matched control stores.  
- Normalized control-store performance using scaling to ensure fair comparison with trial stores.  
- Measured whether trial sales exceeded statistically expected ranges using confidence-based validation.  
- Designed a modern Power BI dashboard summarizing uplift results and customer insights.

## 🎯 Key Outcomes

- One trial store showed a clear, statistically significant positive uplift during the marketing campaign.  
- Another trial store showed moderate uplift with mixed confidence.  
- Premium customers, specific brands, and young-family demographics contributed meaningfully to uplift.  
- Power BI visualizations presented results clearly for business and leadership review.
